The OCR can process an image, decrypting its text and write it under actual text form


Command to compile : 	make
Command to clean :	make clean


Command to launch : 	./OCR
			Will launch the graphic interface


Graphic interface :	On top on the OCR window are three tabs : Test neural network
								  Train neural network
								  About

	*Test neural network : 	choose an image with the button on top of the window 
			       	launch the OCR by clicking on "Get text(neural network)" button
			       	possible to use another method by clicking on "Get text(algorithm)" button
			       	will print the output under the image

	*Train neural network : choose an image with the button on top of the window
				choose the number of iterations to train the OCR
				choose if you want to use an already existing neural network
				write the text on the image in "Write desired output below"
				click on "Launch training" button

	*About :		show informations about our group
